## What are Open Educational Resources?

**Open Educational Resources (OERs)** are free and open educational materials for students and teachers designed to:
 * eliminate the high costs of textbooks,
 * reduce the overall financial burden on students in higher education,
 * increase students' grades and learning in courses,
 * reduce "DFW" (D grade, failure, and withdrawal) rates,
 * provide greater and equal access to education, and
 * provide the ability for teachers to adopt and adapt educational materials for their purposes.

## Goals
The **goals** of this project are to:
 * Provide a **high-quality** open Applied Calculus textbook for university students majoring in:
   - **business**,
   - **education**,
   - **social sciences**, and
   - **life sciences**.
 * Introduce a **mathematical modeling** approach to calculus.
 * Have students analyze and model with **real and realistic data** and scenarios.
 * Incorporate <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> **Calc spreadsheets** (a free alternative to Microsoft **Excel**) to demonstrate how to **model with spreadsheets**. (Business majors use spreadsheets. This will be a distinctive feature of this textbook.)
 * Incorporate **Python** and/or <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> code for students in the life sciences.
 * Create **lecture videos** to accompany the text for students' convenience and to assist with the **online** or **flipped** models of the course.
 * Create an **online version** of the textbook to be displayed in an internet browser using <a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</a>.
