\subsection{Integration By Parts}
{\bf Integration by parts}\index{Integration by parts} is an integration method which enables us to find antiderivatives of some new functions such as $\ln(x)$ as well as antiderivatives of products of functions such as $x^2\ln(x)$ and $xe^x$.

If the function we're trying to integrate can be written as a product of two functions, $u$, and $dv$, then integration by parts lets us trade out a complicated integral for hopefully simpler one.

\begin{theorem}[Integration by Parts Formula]
$$\int u\,dv=uv-\int v\,du$$
For definite integrals:
$$\int_a^bu\,dv = \left.uv\right|_a^b - \int_a^b v \,du$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
Integrate $\int xe^x\,dx$.

\begin{solution}
To use the Integration by Parts method, we break apart the product into two parts:
$$u=x\quad \text{and}\quad dv=e^xdx \enspace .$$
We now calculate $du$, the derivative of $u$, and $v$, the integral of $dv$:
$$du = \left(\frac{d}{dx}x\right)\,dx \quad \text{and} \quad v = \int e^x\,dx = e^x \enspace .$$
Using the Integration by Parts formula,
$$\int xe^x\,dx = uv-\int v\,du = xe^x - \int e^x\,dx \enspace . $$
Notice the remaining integral is simpler that the original, and one which we can easily evaluate:
xex-\int exdx=xex-ex+C.
\end{solution}\end{example}

In the last example we could have chosen either x or ex as our u, but had we chosen u=ex, the second integral would have become messier, rather than simpler.

Rule of Thumb
When selecting the u for Integration by Parts, select a logarithmic expression if one is present. If not, select an algebraic expression (like x or dx).

(There is a larger decision tree that can be written down for choosing u and dv, but since we're not looking at any trigonometric functions in this course the rule above is sufficient for the functions we're integrating.)

\begin{example}
Integrate \int 146x2ln(x)dx.

\begin{solution}
Since this contains a logarithmic expression, we'll use it for our u:
u=ln(x)anddv=6x2dx
We now calculate du and v:
du=1xdxandv=\int 6x2dx=6x33=2x3
Using the By Parts formula:
\int 416x2ln(x)dx=2x3ln(x)]41-\int 416x21xdx
We can simplify the expression in the integral on the right:
\int 416x2ln(x)dx=2x3ln(x)]41-\int 416xdx
The remaining integral is a basic one we can now evaluate:
\int 416x2ln(x)dx=2x3ln(x)]41-3x2]41
Finally, we can evaluate the expressions:
\int 416x2ln(x)dx==\approx   ((2⋅43ln(4))-(2⋅13ln(1)))-((3⋅42)-(3⋅12))128ln(4)-45132.446
\end{solution}\end{example}
