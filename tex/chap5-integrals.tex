\chapter{The Integral: Accumulation of a Rate Function}
\label{ch:integrals}

The previous chapters dealt with Differential Calculus. We started with the simple geometrical idea of the slope of a tangent line to a curve, developed it into a combination of theory about derivatives and their properties, techniques for calculating derivatives, and applications of derivatives. This chapter deals with Integral Calculus and starts with the simple geometric idea of area. This idea will be developed into another combination of theory, techniques, and applications.
