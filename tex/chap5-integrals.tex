\chapter{The Integral: Accumulation of a Rate Function}
\label{ch:integrals}

The previous few chapters dealt with differential calculus, which revolved around the concept of the rate of change of a function. We started with the simple geometric idea of the slope of a tangent line to a curve, developed it into a combination of theory about derivatives and their properties, techniques for calculating derivatives, and applications of derivatives. This chapter deals with integral calculus and starts with the simple geometric idea of area and relates it to the accumulation of a rate function. This idea will be developed into another combination of theory, techniques, and applications.
