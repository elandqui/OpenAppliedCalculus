\section{Models}
\label{sec:models}

A {\bf model} \index{model} or a {\bf mathematical model} is a mathematical framework to help describe some phenomenon, specifically how an input or quantity affects or relates to some output. For example, one could construct a model to speculate how the price of an item affects the demand for that item. This model A model is used to simplify reality. Although good models can be used to predict future events, models do not dictate reality. A model has three main components.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One or more input variables, with specific descriptions of what these variables represent, including units.
    \item One or more functions, with specific descriptions of what the output of the functions represent, including units.
    \item Underlying assumptions that were used to simplify the situation.
\end{enumerate}
