\chapter{Functions of Many Variables}
\label{ch:multivariable}

If youâ€™ve ever hiked, you have probably seen a topographical map. Figure \ref{fig:4-1-topo} shows part of a topographic map of Stowe, Vermont.

Points with the same elevation are connected with curves, so you can read not only your east-west and your north-south location, but also your elevation. You may have also seen weather maps that use the same principle -- points with the same temperature are connected with curves (isotherms), or points with the same atmospheric pressure are connected with curves (isobars). These maps let you read not only a place's location but also its temperature or atmospheric pressure.

In this chapter, we will use that same idea to make graphs of functions of two variables.
