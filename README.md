## What are Open Educational Resources?

**Open Educational Resources (OERs)** are free and open educational materials for students and teachers designed to:
 * eliminate the high costs of textbooks,
 * reduce the overall financial burden on students in higher education,
 * increase students' grades and learning in courses,
 * reduce "DFW" (D grade, failure, and withdrawal) rates,
 * provide greater and equal access to education, and
 * provide the ability for teachers to adopt and adapt educational materials for their purposes.
 
## Goals
The **goals** of this project are to:
 * Provide a **high-quality** open Applied Calculus textbook for university students majoring in:
   - **business**,
   - **education**,
   - **social sciences**, and 
   - **life sciences**.
 * Introduce a **mathematical modeling** approach to calculus.
 * Have students analyze and model with **real and realistic data** and scenarios.
 * Incorporate Microsoft **Excel** and/or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> **Calc spreadsheets** to demonstrate how to **model with spreadsheets**. (Business majors use Excel. This will be a distinctive feature of this textbook.)
 * Incorporate **Python** and/or <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> code for students in the life sciences.
 * Create **lecture videos** to accompany the text for students' convenience and to assist with the **online** or **flipped** models of the course.
 * Create an **online version** of the textbook to be displayed in an internet browser using <a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</a>.
 * Obtain **sponsors** for this project. 
 * Have a reasonably complete version of this textbook to present at **MAA MathFest 2020** (July 29 - August 1 in Philadelphia).
 * Have the textbook hosted on well-known **open textbook websites** for wider dissemination.
 * Distribute **print editions** of the textbook.

## Project Tasks
The following is a rough **task list** for this project.
 * Create an **outline** for the text. (Done)
 * Complete one section on functions (1.2) in a relatively complete form. (Done) 
 * Convert existing open business and applied calculus textbooks from .docx format to **LaTeX** format. (In Progress)
 * Set up means to include **advertisements** in the text or to accept donations to the project. 
 * Improve the **graphics** of the textbook, e.g. graphs, tables, and figures.
 * Overhaul the existing text to introduce a **modeling and data-analytics** approach to calculus.
 * Solicit **reviewers and reviews** for this textbook. (In Progress) 
 * When ready, organize a team of project developers for the textbook.
 * Create **new homework problems** to be used with <a href="https://www.myopenmath.com/">MyOpenMath</a> and/or <a href="http://webwork.maa.org/">WeBWorK</a>.
 * Include "Technology" sections with **spreadsheets** and/or Python and/or <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>.
 * Convert this text to an attractive browser-based version with <a href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</a>, with inline compuations (<a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">Sage Cells</a>) and other dynamic content.
 * Improve the overall **"look and feel"** of the PDF version of the textbook with color, better formatting, etc.
 * Upload the textbook to **well-known OER repositories**: 
   - <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks">Open Textbook Library at the University of Minnesota</a>
   - <a href="https://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/">American Institute of Mathematics Open Textbook Initiative</a>
   - <a href="https://pretextbook.org/gallery.html">PreTeXt Gallery</a>
   - <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/library-publications.html#books">SageMath Library</a>
 * Create a **print edition** of the textbook, either giving it away for free or selling it at or near cost.
 * Create lecture **videos** to accompny the textbook.
